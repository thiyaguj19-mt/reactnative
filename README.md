# Getting Started with React Native

## create-react app

Set up the Expo CLI for scaffolding a React Native starter application on your computer, similar to how you used create-react-app to scaffold out a starter React web app.

### yarn global add expo-cli@4

### expo init nucampsite --name NuCamp -t blank --yarn
